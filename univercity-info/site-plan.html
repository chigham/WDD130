      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose is to build awareness of the benefits of utilizing what the world often calls "alternative transportation," which suggests cars are the default. Other modes are greener, safer, and more friendly to the community and the planet. My website will express that and give relevant suggestion how to live this new lifestyle.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is university students or urban dwellers who are prime candidates to transition from being dependent on cars to choosing public transportation, bikes, scooters, and the pedestrian lifestyle. My message is also for mothers, the least likely cohort to incorporate non-car transportation, who can teach these principles to their children, the next generation of university students and other urban dwellers.</p>

      <p>Did you know that you are healthier when you ride the train? Walking and 2-wheel vehicles provide more intimacy with local businesses, parks and people. Forget looking for a parking space and risk getting ticketed only to backtrack and walk to and from your destination anyway. More time for self-reflection and less road rage and commuter traffic. Reduce emissions without the price tag and hassle of an electric vehicle (EV). Cars offer freedom, but in today's world they are also a trap. Help your community become car-optional, and not car-dependent. Uber ($$$) should be a last resort, not your go-to. Get involved in the policy-making process. Learn about the things that shape your community, like zoning laws and public infrastructure. Call your local, state and national leaders. Attend intragovernmental and intra-agency meetings and demand change. Teach your children TO talk to strangers in public space and make new friends. Learn how current transit may not benefit everyone equally, as public safety policy and privilege play their roles. If you have a car or two, consider selling and "upgrading" for a bike, scooter, walking shoes, and a bus pass -- your wallet will thank you even if Exxon, State Farm, and Jiffy Lube won't. Pass on the parking pass. Reduce the 40+ thousand US deaths per year caused by automobiles. Watch and listen to local street performers. Live your best urban life in college and beyond.</p>

      <h4>Mission</h4>
      <p>It's our mission to invigorate and educate the young adults entering the world and moving from place to place to do wo with autonomy, their health and the community in mind. This means challenging the car-required mindset in cities, college campuses, and even suburbs where public transportation and safe public infrastructure make choosing other mobility options available and even preferable. In other parts of the world cars are considered expensive luxuries that come with a price much larger than the monetary value, rather than a need. We excitedly proclaim that in American communities this is true as well.</p>

      <p>However, this is not true everywhere, and there are downsides to rejecting car culture. Travel between urban centers, safety concerns, low-population density, urban sprawl, negative public opinion of subways and busses, poor lighting at night, ableism, racism, systems that neglect poor people to cater to the tax base who drive luxury cars. These are just some of the obstacles that make UniverCity living a challenge. We also educate on current issues related to transit and pedestrian lifestyles and how you can effect public policy to address these issues.</p>

      <p>UniverCity is funded entirely by Christopher Higham, a poor college veteran and urbanist himself.</p>

      <h3>How To</h3>
      <p>Perhaps you are already convinced of the benefits of ditching your car for UniverCity living. Maybe you already have. Or you might want to be less dependent on your car but don't know how. Here are practical applications for how you can rely more on your feet, public transportation in your community, and smaller sustainable vehicles like bikes and scooters. These principles apply whether you live on campus or in a small or large city with relevant transportation infrastructure and services.</p>

      <h4>Where to Start</h4>

      <p>The first thing to do is consider if your community actually allows for UniverCity living transportation options. If you are in a rural home outside of town, transit may not be an option, but walking and biking can be. If you live in a tiny apartment with limited storage, a personal bike may not make sense. Physical disabilities must also be considered.</p>

      <p>Most likely, some non-car method(s) will make sense. If you can walk, a good pair of sneakers is a must. There are a plethora of apps that can be used to plan and pay for your trips besides the Uber app. See below for more.</p>

      <h4>Practical Tips and Tricks</h4>
      <h5>For Students</h5>
      <ul>
        <li></li>Find out if your campus has a shuttle that services your home
        <li></li>Does the local public transit agency offer free or discounted passes to students?
        <li></li>Take a class on civic engagement or local government and research communities for your projects
      </ul>
      <h5>Two Feet</h5>
      <ul>
        <li></li>Buy the best walking shoes you can reasonably afford
        <li></li>If your destination is less than 3/4 miles, walk
        <li></li>Consider clothing other than shoes and an umbrella
        <li></li>Stay safe! Walk with someone at night if you can and invest in pepper spray or a rape whistle.
      </ul>
      <h5>Transit and Small Vehicles</h5>
      <ul>
        <li></li>Download free apps like transit agency apps, Citymapper and Lime
        <li></li>Plan your trips with Google Maps and use the transit option
        <li></li>Purchase or lease a bike or eScooter
        <li></li>Make friends who use transit and share ideas with each other
      </ul>

      <h4>Ideas for Parents</h4>
      <p>Take your kids downtown for a day trip and leave the car at home. Bring cash or purchase fare passes in advance, and bring your walking shoes. This shows the kids that UniverCity living can be fun, and you might be surprised by enjoying it yourself!</p>
      <p>When possible, run errands with your kids on foot or on the bus. Talk about their life, bond, take notice of your surroundings. Talk to different kinds of beautiful people you meet and wish them well. Set the example of UniverCity living, even if only occasionally.</p>
      <p>There's so much you can do! Buy your kids bikes and scooters and encourage them to use them. Discuss their favorite places to walk or bike and what parts of town they consider dangerous and why they think that is. Take them to a city meeting and talk about it. Visit a college campus. Show them a zoning map and discuss each type of zone. Get creative!</p>
